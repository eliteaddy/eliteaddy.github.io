Well, either programming is worth it or not, you should be the judge of that. But if you're about to quit programming. Just try to read this article before deciding and I'll give you reasons to quit or not to. So the decision will be yours to take after the article.

## The Beginning 

I started programming when I didn't even know what I was doing back when I was in secondary school. At that time we used to create websites at wapka.mobi and I'll just browse online on how to implement some stuff. 

Tho I never really understand what I was doing and all I used to do is just copy and paste the codes. But I believe that was the beginning of it because it gives me joy whenever I see the outcome of what I did. 

## The Journey 

So, fast forward to when I entered my first year in the university, I started a blog about tech, and I named it tech and tips. Which was gaining little attention then. And I was learning to program too and I started designing websites with HTML and CSS with a little knowledge of JavaScript. And I focused on PHP for the backend to build my website. 

While I was doing all this for fun with a little bit of planning that I'll surely come up with an idea that could be useful to society in the future, I was introduced to freelance. Which clients that I faced nearly made me want to question why I started programming because it wasn't easy and I feel used.

After doing it for some time, I quit programming for some months. And I get back into with some personal project. Although not all the clients are bad, most people think writing a program is as simple as just drag and drop something on the screen. 

While I was passing through this, I saw someone, who's story is a little bit like mine at the beginning, but he took a different approach. Which is, he associated himself with other programmers that are more experienced than him. 

## My Mistake

While I did all my learning online, and he did the same thing, he has mentors who are guiding him and as well learning from without even been thought directly. having a mentor who can guide you through what they've done before is a really big deal because it will help you to skip those mistakes they went through.

Not that I didn't have mentors but I just don't choose people in my surroundings. I followed the steps of the people I saw online and created my path. The little mistake that I made was I didn't consider my surroundings and how people around me find their way through all the challenges they faced.

## Proposed Solution 

Tho, I'm still on the verge of quitting, but I couldn't because of the joy I got while doing it, which is what made me stayed on the line till now. And if you're planning to quit, there are questions you should ask yourself which are:

### Why did I start in the first instance?

Mine was that I started it because I love to see the results of what I'm doing, it gives me joy. 

### Will, I not regret it if I stopped now?

Sincerely, if you do your research well, you'll see that the programming is a hot cake and people are taking their bites of it. It's not going anywhere unless you decide to choose wrong. 

### What made me want to quit?

Mine is simple, it's high time I start making money from it, but now I'm not getting much from it compared to my friends that choose other carriers like graphics designs, crypto, and UI/UX.

In conclusion, what I discovered is that, I didn't make money because I did not go all out to show people what I could do, while I was in the room working on the project of others without planning how I want to use my skills. 

### How am I trying to fix that?

I created a portfolio website for myself and I'm updating it on my social media accounts and all my projects are on it. 

There are many ways to make money being a programmer, but whichever way you wanna choose, make sure you are following it and you're consistent and believe me, you'll be happy to you didn't quit.
